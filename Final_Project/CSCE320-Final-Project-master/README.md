# Good Cop, Bad Cop


## Description: 
This project consists of an analysis of the demographics of US Police Shooting victims. Our initial question was: "Can certain demographics effect someone's chance of experiencing police violence?" After getting feedback from peers and cleaning our data, this question evolved to look at how many encounters actually became violent and how are levels of violence evolving based on age (police use of force for people over 50 vs. people under 30). New questions that were considered throughout the analysis: "How does the levels of force vary by race?" "How effective are certain types of force used?" We created a Google Colaboratory with all the steps taken to gather insight into this topic.

## Installation: 
There are two ways to run this project:
- Access and run on the Colaboratory platform: [Good Cop, Bad Cop](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ieM4WkXmIRAKQ92RbYAco8BWGPPimgZa?usp=sharing)
- Download and run locally:
    1. Clone this repository
    2. Download the [Police Stops](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/minneapolis-police-stops-and-police-violence?select=police_stop_data.csv) dataset from Kaggle.com because the file was too large to add to the repository, but the other datasets used are in the repository.
    3. Install the following Python libraries/dependencies:
        - Jupyter Notebooks
        - Pandas
        - Seaborn
        - Matplotlib
        - Dask
        - NumPy
        - NLTK
        - WordCloud
        - Math
        - Scipy
        - scikit-learn

## Usage:
With both local installation and use of the Colaboratory, the project should already have cells with results and visualizations shown, but to run the project, Colaboratory and Jupyter Notebooks both can be used to rerun the cells sequentially if all datasets and dependencies have been added.
